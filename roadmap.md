# ðŸ“œ Roadmap

The Syntech MERN dashboard build is a first step in a larger Solana Ecosystem initiative that has been in the works for some time now, focused on education, inclusion, sustainable blockchain operations, and several other points of emphasis that align with core Solana Foundation values.&#x20;

As such, the following is the proposed order of operations in implementing phase one of a broader overall initiative. While the details of later phases are somewhat irrelevant until the first phase of our overall platform rollout has been executed, the context and why more than just a product are being proposed; and it serves to explain better, why we are requesting the full allotment of 25K allowed through this particular initiative.&#x20;

* Begin development of working product model within one week of funding approval&#x20;
* Within three to four working weeks of development, link source code in development via domain of where the final product will be permanently hosted. Included with early additional educational material framework. Have developmental open source code available via Github. (password protected until rollout)
* Begin physical networking via Solana events February 2024
