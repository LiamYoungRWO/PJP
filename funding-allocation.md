# üèØ Funding Allocation

I'm just gonna delete all this and throw the numbers we have in here really fast. We'll ask for the whole thing; pretty sure they'll give it to us if we've got a product.



* 10K Tommy = enough to live in for 5 months but you gonna have to make some of this stuff if I show you how since we're really not supposed to use this for this and we need to make it obvious we put a lot of AI work in.. probably just make it 8K and thats 4 months and enough time to do a lot realistically
* 5K Ready pay... absolute minimum I can do for all of this at this point
* 5K Wacy (so an extra 1,500 not listed that can be used by project)&#x20;
* 5K left ... it goes fast, graphics card should be in there, but can do a 4090 for 12-1400 or go a grade down for a lot less and do a 3090ti or whatever and that's fine too&#x20;
* Need to figure out a cut for Coin as well so validator is probably out on this budgeting but that's fine for now
