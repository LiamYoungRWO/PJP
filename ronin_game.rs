// This is the begginging of a codebase to build a strategy based game model for a fuedal Japanse style PVP game optimized through Rust for speed and functionality as well as ease of expansion. 
// The basic idea will be oriented around feudal Japanese strategy gameplay, where ronins (samurais without masters) try to establish their own territories and engage in battles. 

// _Structure:_

// 1. _Ronin:_ A struct representing a ronin with properties like name, strength, intelligence, and territory.
// 2. _Territory:_ A struct representing a piece of land with properties like size, resources, and defense.
// 3. _Battle:_  A function that takes two ronins and decides the winner based on some strategy.
// 4. _AqquireTerritory:_ A function that allows a ronin to acquire a territory, adjusting the properties of the ronin and the territory accordingly.
// 5. _MainLoop:_ The core gameplay loop where players take turns performing actions.

 _Concept Code Sterting Structure_

struct Ronin {
    name: String,
    strength: u32,
    intelligence: u32,
    territory: Territory,
}

struct Territory {
    name: String,
    size: u32,
    resources: u32,
    defense: u32,
}

fn battle(ronin1: &Ronin, ronin2: &Ronin) -> &str {
    // Implement your battle logic here
    // Example: the ronin with the higher strength wins
    if ronin1.strength > ronin2.strength {
        &ronin1.name
    } else {
        &ronin2.name
    }
}

fn acquire_territory(ronin: &mut Ronin, territory: Territory) {
    // Implement the logic for a ronin acquiring a territory
    // Example: add the territory size to the ronin's strength
    ronin.strength += territory.size;
    ronin.territory = territory;
}

fn main() {
    let mut ronin1 = Ronin {
        name: "Ronin1".to_string(),
        strength: 10,
        intelligence: 8,
        territory: Territory {
            name: "Territory1".to_string(),
            size: 5,
            resources: 10,
            defense: 3,
        },
    };
    
    let mut ronin2 = Ronin {
        name: "Ronin2".to_string(),
        strength: 12,
        intelligence: 7,
        territory: Territory {
            name: "Territory2".to_string(),
            size: 7,
            resources: 8,
            defense: 4,
        },
    };

    // Example of a battle
    println!("The winner is: {}", battle(&ronin1, &ronin2));

    // Example of acquiring a new territory
    let new_territory = Territory {
        name: "Territory3".to_string(),
        size: 6,
        resources: 9,
        defense: 2,
    };
    acquire_territory(&mut ronin1, new_territory);
}

// _Explanation_ 

// _Ronin Struct:_ Represents a ronin with attributes like name, strength, and intelligence.
// _Territory Struct:_ Represents a territory with attributes like name, size, and resources.
// _Battle Function:_ Takes two ronins as parameters and returns the name of the winning ronin based on some logic.
// _AcquireTerritory Function:_ Allows a ronin to acquire a new territory, modifying their properties.
// _Main:_ Initializes two ronins and showcases a battle and territory acquisition as an example.

// This code is a basic starting point and is not meant to be a fully functional game. 
//  Expand upon these basic structures and functions, adding features like multiple territories, alliances, betrayals, resource management, and more to create a more engaging strategy game. 
// Ensure you manage states correctly and create user interfaces (CLI/GUI) for player interactions.
