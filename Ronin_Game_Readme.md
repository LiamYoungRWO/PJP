### README.md for RoninStrategy Game

# RoninStrategy

**RoninStrategy** is a simple yet captivating strategy game based on feudal Japanese gameplay, where ronins (masterless samurais) battle and strategize to acquire territories and resources. The primary goal is to create a solid strategy to manage resources, forge alliances, engage in tactical battles, and expand territories to establish dominance in the feudal era.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: The core game logic is implemented in Rust. Ensure Rust is installed on your machine to run the game engine.
- Additional frameworks and languages will be explored in the [Development Path](#development-path).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/RoninStrategy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```
3. Engage in the preliminary CLI-based gameplay and explore the foundational logic.

## Gameplay Overview

### Core Components
- **Ronin**: Represents a warrior with attributes such as strength and intelligence that influence battle outcomes and strategic options.
- **Territory**: Represents a land parcel that ronins can acquire to gain resources and enhance their capabilities.
- **Battle**: Engage two ronins in a duel, determining the victor through strategic computations based on their attributes and possessions.

### Strategies
- Acquire territories to increase resources and strategic options.
- Engage in battles wisely, considering your ronin's strengths and weaknesses relative to your opponent.
- Form alliances and navigate through the complex political and social scenarios of the feudal era.

## Technical Overview

### Current Implementation
- Written in **Rust**, the initial codebase provides foundational structures (`Ronin`, `Territory`) and basic functions (`battle`, `acquire_territory`) to illustrate core gameplay mechanics.
- The gameplay loop and further strategic elements are to be developed.

### Future Integrations
- **GUI**: Implement a graphical user interface using frameworks like `druid` or `gtk` to enhance user experience.
- **Networking**: Integrate multiplayer functionality using networking libraries (e.g., `tokio` or `async-std`) to facilitate online gameplay.
- **Database**: Utilize databases (e.g., `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL`) to store and manage player data, scores, and history.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web interface using `WASM` (WebAssembly) to enable gameplay directly through web browsers.
- **AI**: Implement AI opponents using machine learning libraries (e.g., `TensorFlow` for Rust) for single-player modes and dynamic gameplay.

## Development Path
1. **Game Logic Enhancement**: Introduce more attributes, complex battle algorithms, and diversified territories.
2. **User Interface**: Develop a GUI for an engaging and intuitive user experience.
3. **Networking**: Enable multiplayer options through networked gameplay.
4. **Persistent Data Management**: Implement database management for user data and gameplay history.
5. **Web Adaptation**: Adapt the game for web platforms using WebAssembly.
6. **AI Integration**: Develop AI logic for versatile and challenging gameplay.
