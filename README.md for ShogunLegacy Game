## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Initial backend logic is implemented in Python.
- **TypeScript**: Additional development, especially for front-end, will utilize TypeScript.
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed for TypeScript compilation and running JS scripts.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ShogunLegacy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script for a CLI-based battle simulation:
   ```
   python shogun_legacy.py
   ```
3. For TypeScript implementations, navigate to the respective directory, install dependencies, compile and run the script:
   ```
   npm install
   tsc [TypeScriptFileName].ts
   node [TypeScriptFileName].js
   ```

## Gameplay Overview

### Core Components
- **Warrior**: A character with specific attributes like strength, defense, and health.
- **Battle**: A function to conduct a battle between two warriors, determining the victor based on their attributes and attack-defense computations.

### Development Ideas
- **Character Classes**: Develop various character classes, each possessing unique abilities and weaknesses.
- **Storyline**: Weave a storyline that intertwines historic and fantastical elements of feudal Japan.
- **Multiplayer**: Introduce multiplayer functionalities for player-vs-player battles.
- **World Exploration**: Enable players to explore a world filled with quests, allies, enemies, and mysteries.

## Technical Overview

### Current Implementation
- **Python**: Basic logic for warrior attributes and battle mechanics are implemented in Python.

### Future Integrations
- **TypeScript / JavaScript**: Implement frontend and additional backend logic using TypeScript. Transition from a CLI-based system to a GUI, possibly employing a game engine or framework like Phaser.
  
### TypeScript Example: `warriorBattle.ts`

```typescript
class Warrior {
    name: string;
    strength: number;
    defense: number;
    health: number;

    constructor(name: string, strength: number, defense: number, health: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.strength = strength;
        this.defense = defense;
        this.health = health;
    }

    attack(opponent: Warrior): void {
        const damage: number = this.strength - opponent.defense;
        opponent.health -= Math.max(0, damage);
    }

    isAlive(): boolean {
        return this.health > 0;
    }
}

function battle(warrior1: Warrior, warrior2: Warrior): void {
    let turn = Math.random() < 0.5 ? warrior1 : warrior2;
    
    while (warrior1.isAlive() && warrior2.isAlive()) {
        if (turn === warrior1) {
            warrior1.attack(warrior2);
            turn = warrior2;
        } else {
            warrior2.attack(warrior1);
            turn = warrior1;
        }
    }

    console.log(`${warrior1.isAlive() ? warrior1.name : warrior2.name} emerges victorious!`);
}

const samurai = new Warrior("Samurai", 15, 5, 100);
const ninja = new Warrior("Ninja", 12, 8, 100);

battle(samurai, ninja);
```

## Development Path
- Expand the variety of characters, weapons, and abilities.
- Develop a GUI, possibly transitioning to a web-based game using HTML5 and Phaser.
- Introduce a rich storyline and quest system.
- Implement multiplayer functionalities using WebSockets for real-time interactions.
