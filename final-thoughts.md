# â›© Final Thoughts

What this funding further assists is the growth and fortification of a set of systems that are meant to be robust and scalable, but also easily maintained and built upon regardless of market conditions.&#x20;

The decision to approach The Foundation was not made lightly or without imploring the use of a dynamic and thorough approach to doing so, and making use of our own funds over an extended period of time to test the systems we plan to contribute to, and build the&#x20;

While we are aware that these allotments are considered on the smaller end of funding in terms of grant applications and awards, we look to treat any and all situations of this sort as if we were asking for much more, and we prefer to be able to demonstrate the prototyping and early design elements of a well thought out product that brings true value to the ecosystem. &#x20;

Skin in the game

First impressions are important, and we have laid the groundwork for what we hope to be a longstanding relationship with the Solana Ecosystem, where we are seen as contributors and growth leaders in the space well into the future. While some of us have abstained from the necessary political and networking elements, while building silently and analyzing the ecosystem's interpersonal functions, we have done so in a calculated manner so that when it mattered; we could integrate ourselves properly and with the right actors.&#x20;

We wouldn't have landed here after several years in the space, and stopped looking pretty quickly for an end all platform, if we didn't feel that we need look no further once developing a more informed and deeper understanding of the core tech. We believe Solana to be the only blockchain  all of the necessary elements of scalability and mass adoption. This makes our mission and what we build from here extraordinarily easy in that single sense of not concerning ourselves with the notion of if the underlying platform will still be relevant in several years and beyond.&#x20;

Feel free to reach out at shea@abnaturalbalance.tech with any further questions, or to schedule a call regarding this proposal; and thank you for your time in looking it over.&#x20;
